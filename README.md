- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Wouter.
- I currently live in Delft.
- I am a bachelor's student Mechanical Engineering at the Delft University of Technology.
- I also work at Dynamic Ear company, and sometimes code there when the job calls for it.
- I mostly enjoy spending 10 hours automating a process that could've been done by hand in 5!
